This blog (work in progress) tried to get you familiar with the tools and concepts that I use in day to day basis.

# Concepts

The **Block, Element, Modifier** methodology (commonly referred to as [BEM]) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS.  Its goal is to help developers better understand the relationship between the HTML and CSS in a given project. Here is a quick example:

```css
/* Block component */
.btn {}

/* Element that depends upon the block */ 
.btn__price {}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.btn--orange {} 
.btn--big {}
```
